PROMPT_COPY_TEXT_TTS = '''Copy all the text from this image. Preserve the original formatting, including line breaks. Never translate the text, keep original languages in text! Rewrite the text for TTS reading:

1. Numbers: Write all numbers in words. For decimal fractions, use the separator for the integer and fractional parts accepted in the original language and pronounce it with the corresponding word. For example: 0.25 - "zero point twenty-five" (for a point), 3.14 - "three comma fourteen" (for a comma).
2. Abbreviations: Expand all abbreviations into full words corresponding to the original language. For example: "kg" - "kilogram" (for the English language).
3. Dates: Write dates in words, preserving the order of day, month, and year accepted in the original language. For example, for the English language (US): January 1st, 2024.
4. Symbols: Replace all & symbols with the word corresponding to the conjunction "and" in the original language.
5. Symbol №: Replace with the word 'number'.
6. Mathematical expressions: Rewrite in words: √ - square root of, ∑ - sum, ∫ - integral, ≠ - not equal to, ∞ - infinity, π - pi, α - alpha, β - beta, γ - gamma.
7. Punctuation: After periods, make a longer pause, after commas - a shorter one.
8. URLs:
* If the URL is short, simple, and understandable (for example, google.com, youtube.com/watch, vk.com/id12345), pronounce it completely, following the reading rules for known and unknown domains, as well as subdomains. For known domains (.ru, .com, .org, .net, .рф), pronounce them as abbreviations. For example, ".ru" - "dot ru", ".com" - "dot com", ".рф" - "dot er ef". For unknown domains, pronounce them character by character. Subdomains, if possible, read in words.
    * If the URL is long, complex, or contains many special characters, do not pronounce it completely. Instead, mention that there is a link in the text, and, if possible, indicate the domain or briefly describe what it leads to. For example: "There is a link to the website example dot com in the text" or "Further in the text there is a link to a page with detailed information".
    * When reading a domain, do not pronounce "www".
    * If the URL is not important for understanding the text, you can ignore it.

    Use your knowledge of the structure of URLs to determine if it is simple and understandable.

Examples:

* https://google.com - "google dot com"
* youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ - "youtube dot com slash watch question mark v equals ... (do not read further)"
* https://www.example.com/very/long/and/complex/url/with/many/parameters?param1=value1&param2=value2 - "There is a long link to the website example dot com in the text"
* 2+2≠5 - "two plus two is not equal to five"'''

This bot utilizes only free models. However, if you wish to utilize all other models within this bot, you can create a paid account on the website https://openrouter.ai and insert the API key from that site into this bot.

This will grant you access to all commercial models at manufacturer prices, or even cheaper.

You can create an API key here: https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys

View the list of available models here: https://openrouter.ai/models

Use the command `/openrouter <API key>` to insert your key.

Use the command `/openrouter` to view settings and switch to this mode.

Use the command `/model <model name>` to select a model, for example, `/model openai/o1-preview` will select the o1-preview model from OpenAI.

"What do the buttons below my messages mean?"
➡️ (Right Arrow): Prompts the bot to continue the conversation or generate the next response.
♻️ (Circular Arrows): Clears the bot's memory and starts a new conversation.
🙈 (Hands Covering Eyes): Hides or deletes the current message or response.
📢 (Megaphone): Plays the text aloud using Text-to-Speech (TTS).
📸 (Camera): Displays Google Images search results based on your request.

help_msg2 = '''В этом боте есть 2 разных режима работы.

1. В основном режиме все бесплатные ключи пользователей перемешаны и используются совместно. Доступны избранные модели через меню /config. Никаких лимитов в них нет, но работать они могут нестабильно. Что бы это могло нормально работать вам надо принести боту 3 ключа, один от gemini, второй от groq и третий от huggingface, смотрите инструкцию в команде /keys.

2. Второй режим тут называется "openrouter", в меню его кнопка появляется только если вы дадите боту свой персональный ключ от какого то конкретного сервиса, предполагается что платного, но не обязательно, это может быть и бесплатный сервис из тех что нет в основном режиме. Если это платный сервис типа openrouter.ai то он будет работать намного стабильнее и только для вас.

**Еще раз** - ключи от бесплатных сервисов надо передавать боту командой /keys, они будут использоваться совместно, ключи от платных сервисов - команда /openrouter для персонального использования.

Основной режим работает сразу для всех даже если у вас нет никаких ключей.


"Openrouter" надо настраивать вручную. Сначала вставить ключ, потом адрес, и потом модель.

Пример для мистраля:

Адрес:
/openrouter https://api.mistral.ai/v1
Ключ:
/openrouter xxxxxx
Модель:
/model mistral-large-latest
В меню /config должна будет появится кнопка Openrouter для переключения на эту модель.
